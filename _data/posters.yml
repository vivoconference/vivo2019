  :abstract: 'The Danish project OPERA, Open Research Analytics, is a joint collaboration
    between Danish Universities as well as international partners. The project is
    exploring new approaches to best practice research analytics that should be useful,
    relevant and responsible and furthermore acknowledging Open Science endeavors
    across research areas.    The OPERA project is work in progress and already showing
    promising results. Some of the fundamental elements in the project is the VIVO
    platforms showcasing university specific advanced research analytics and a national
    VIVO platform populated with Dimensions data as well as complementing metadata
    underlining the Open Science elements, advanced network analysis and modules exploring
    the collaboration potential of Danish universities.   The poster will highlight
    the halfway results and stipulate the next steps and expected outcomes.  '

  :authors: Sergey Parinov
  :abstract: 'The Citec project funded by RANEPA provides open citation content data
    parsed from research papers in PDF available at RePEc and Socionet research information
    system. One of current activities of the Cirtec project is a design of author-oriented
    services, data and indicators based on citation data parsed from three groups
    of research papers linked with a specific author. These three groups of papers
    for each author are: (1)  own papers of a specific author, which available at
    RePEc by linkages from an author profile in RePEc Author Service; (2) papers cited
    by this author, which can be collected using CitEc citation relationships to the
    author papers available at RePEc; (3) citing papers for this author, which available
    by links from CitEc citation relationships available at RePEc. '
- :title: 'OpenDMP: an open and interoperable platform for FAIR data and DMPs '
  :authors: Georgios Kakaletris, Diamantis Tziotzios, Ioannis Kalyvas, Elli Papadopoulou
  :abstract: 'One of the aims of Open Science is to foster reproducibility and reusability
    of research outputs. Hence, Open Science covers the whole research lifecycle to
    create links between the different steps and processes by securing the provenance
    of data and by enabling retractability of raw and processed data (incl. versioned
    data) at any time during and after a project ends, while documenting and informing
    about the processes undertaken to derive results. A Data Management Plan (DMP)
    contains information concerning the research processes, the data utilized and
    generated throughout a project’s lifetime, and the policies surrounding them.
    Still lacks automated solutions and workflows that connect the DMP to the actual
    data where they are stored and link to other useful information such as publications
    and funding information, thus enabling the creation of coherent/complete research
    entities. In an open and FAIR research ecosystem that is currently being realised,
    information linking between research processes and research outputs is essential.
    OpenDMP is the joint effort of OpenAIRE and EUDAT to deliver an open platform
    for Data Management Planning that addresses those demands/ issues and assumes
    no barriers for its use and adoption. It does so by applying common standards
    for machine-actionable DMPs as defined by the global research data community of
    RDA and by communicating and consulting with researchers, research communities
    and funders to better reflect on their needs.      The demo presentation will
    cover the OpenDMP platform that provides the scientific community with a free,
    open and flexible instrument for the handling, validation and dissemination of
    their data management plans, in line with policies settled by a variety of funding
    agencies, institutions and other initiatives. OpenDMP work was inspired by the
    lack of a platform that may adapt to any and all requirements that may be present
    in a data management planning environment. It aims to combine the flexibility
    of adhoc questionnaires with the power of a structured information system while
    capturing the semantics of a data management plan, and the rigidness of funding
    and/or validation rules. It also attempts to embrace the need for collaboration
    around the structuring of a data management plan, its evolution and sharing. Moreover,
    it emphasizes on achieving interoperability and enabling actionability of data
    management plans, that will allow systems to not only validate, but also to automate
    tedious, currently user driven, activities.   In the demo section, the audience
    will be offered:   A very short introduction on the concept of data management
    and its relation to open science policies and best practices.   An overview of
    key concepts of the data management planning, as incorporated in OpenDMP, with
    a focus on FAIR DMPs. Those will cover projects, funders, dataset profiles, data
    management plans, dataset descriptions, contributors etc.   An overview of the
    key features of OpenDMP that differentiate it from other solutions that existed,
    exist or emerge.   A brief overview of the technology that allows OpenDMP to be
    modern, attractive, performant and open.   A walk through the systems’ functionality
    with hands on access to the system, that will unveil all main project features
    to the audience.   A preview of the plans of the implementation team for latest
    developments towards interoperable, actionable data management planning.   Further
    information of how to get access and exploit the free and open services of OpenDMP,
    in any of the supported manners, be it institutional, national or following other
    scopes. '

  :authors: Tudor Sorin Andrei
  :abstract: 'Auto-generated charts from declarative (json) code open the path to
    having a common language for collaboration. The implications are not just theoretical.  This
    demo showcases how a feature planned with Statecharts but coded with  React.js
    can be easily adapted into plain Javascript while retaining the majority of the
    original code.   This demo intends to offer a glimpse of how Statecharts can enable
    smooth collaboration between code contributors whose institutions have adopted
    different technologies. '
- :title: Refining InCites Benchmarking & Analytics with verified VIVO data
  :authors: M. Benjamin Gross, Miguel Garcia, Marko Zavko, Rohit Kulkarni
  :abstract: InCites is a benchmarking and analytics tool built upon best-in-class
    Web of Science data that enables comprehensive insight into your organization’s
    performance. Currently in beta release, Clarivate has recently introduced the
    “My Organization” module for InCites that enables users to refine the InCites
    dataset using their own verified faculty and disambiguation data.   InCites with
    My Organization delivers standardized researcher, team & departmental reporting
    to increase relevance of bibliometric data for all users. Leveraging the data
    produced from existing workflows users have developed to build their VIVO databases,
    MyOrg subscribers can easily populate their MyOrg module database with VIVO data
    using open-source Python code available on GitHub at https://github.com/Clarivate-SAR.
