#### Call for Poster and Demo Proposals, Second Early Bird Registration

If you missed the earlier deadline, you have until July 16 to [submit your poster or demo abstract](https://forms.gle/xLGyGsdT58jJBmMc7). The poster/demo session lets you share your work in an informal, relaxed setting and chat with individual community members. Attendees will view and discuss your work during the poster/demo reception.
Demos will be held during the poster session.  The person presenting the demo should provide the equipment (a fully charged laptop).


Submissions should explore or illustrate innovative VIVO implementations, integration with other systems, or methods of tracking and displaying scholarly impact. We encourage submissions that demonstrate the use of semantic technologies to represent scholars and their work, as well as those that illustrate teams and communities collaborating across disciplines. 
[Share your posters and demos](https://forms.gle/xLGyGsdT58jJBmMc7) with the VIVO community before July 16, 2019.
