#### Things to do in Podgorica

Podgorica is the capital of Montenegro with a population of about 150,000 positioned in the middle of the country, in a picturesque area with 2 rivers.  In addition, in 2017 Montenegro has been chosen by [Vogue magazine](https://www.vogue.com/article/montenegro-best-new-travel-destination-guide) as one of the most tempting destinations to travel, because of its natural beauty and more affordable prices compared to its neighbors Italy and Croatia.

The conference center in [Podgorica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podgorica) is located close to cultural monuments such as: [Ribnica fortres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribnica_(fortress)), [Old city and Clock tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_Tower_(Podgorica)), [King Nikola’s winter residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podgorica_Royal_Palace#/media/File:WInter_Royal_Palace_in_Podgorica.jpg) and [Kings park](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304088-d7258648-Reviews-King_s_Park-Podgorica_Podgorica_Municipality.html).
