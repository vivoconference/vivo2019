#### Program Chair

Ruben Verborgh is a professor of Semantic Web technology at Ghent University – IMEC and a research affiliate at the Decentralized Information Group at MIT. The VIVO community had a chance to hear Professor Verborgh at the VIVO 2016 Conference when he presented his talk: [“The Future is Federated”](https://figshare.com/articles/The_Future_is_Federated/3680310) and lead a workshop titled: “Linked Data Fragments: Hands-On Publishing and Querying.” The leadership of the VIVO project was inspired by his presentations and added the Triple Pattern Fragments (TPF) server to the VIVO software.

Professor Verborgh aims to build a more intelligent generation of clients for a decentralized Web at the intersection of Linked Data and hypermedia-driven Web APIs. Through the creation of Linked Data Fragments, he introduced a new paradigm for query execution at Web-scale. He has co-authored two books on Linked Data, and contributed to more than 250 publications for international conferences and journals on Web-related topics.

#### About Podgorica

As the capital of Montenegro, Podgorica is used to hosting events of similar size. In addition, in 2017 Montenegro has been chosen by [Vogue magazine](https://www.vogue.com/article/montenegro-best-new-travel-destination-guide) as one of the most tempting destinations to travel, because of its natural beauty and significantly more affordable prices compared to its neighbors Italy, Greece, and Croatia.

Podgorica is the capital of Montenegro with population of about 150,000, positioned in the middle of the country, in a picturesque area with 2 rivers. Prepare to swim, hike, and enjoy the natural beauty of Montenegro before, after, or maybe during the conference.

The conference center in [Podgorica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podgorica) is located close to cultural monuments such as: [Ribnica fortres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ribnica_(fortress)), [Old city and Clock tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_Tower_(Podgorica)), [King Nikola’s winter residence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podgorica_Royal_Palace#/media/File:WInter_Royal_Palace_in_Podgorica.jpg) and [Kings park](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g304088-d7258648-Reviews-King_s_Park-Podgorica_Podgorica_Municipality.html).
